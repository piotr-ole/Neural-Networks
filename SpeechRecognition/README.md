Project focuses on commands recognition from Google Speech Recognition Challange.
1. Preprocessing.ipynb contains code used to prepare data for training. Especially, changing audio files into picture representations.
1. Network.ipynb contains all code of neural network. Worth to note is that networks were trained on Google Colab so code is written to work in that enviroment. Especially, there is no testing of gpu availability, because it is provided here.
2. Report.pdf contains project details and results of network performance. Different experiments are described. (It's written in Polish language)
